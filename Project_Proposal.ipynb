This is instead of having to get advice from retail sales associates who are incentivized to push products. It's no wonder that, according to Northwestern University's Spiegel Research Center, [almost 95% of online shoppers consult reviews before making a purchase](https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/_pdf/Spiegel_Online%20Review_eBook_Jun2017_FINAL.pdf). \n",

One such example is [brushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushing_(e-commerce)), where business owners buy their own products in order to review them as \"verified\" purchasers. Less dubious methods are common as well. The Spiegel Center report highlights several innocuous factors that can be manipulated to influence consumer behavior. \n",
